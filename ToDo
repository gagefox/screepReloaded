/** This is the general ToDo List **//

*****Please add a detailed outline of operation of each function right above the declaration in the source files*****
This list is to give ideas and general outlines but does not need to be followed by the T.

-Current Tasks (see below for detailed descriptions)
    -Niko
        todo create code for low lvl creeps (source, harvester, smallMiner, Builder and upGrader)
    -Blake
        todo make sure the initial tutorial code complies and runs without errors on the actual screeps server
        todo create beginnings of civLevel code
    -whos next??

-Room
    civLevel
        /* Outline of operation
            civLevel(0)
                will only spawn harvester, builder and upgraders
                as of now must manually place roads and extensions.
            civLevel(1)
        */
        todo create civlevel function so the spawner will correctly spawn creeps for civLevel(0)


-Buildings
    Turret
        todo create actual logic
    Source
        todo create persistent memory that other creeps can access to know how many and who is mining that particular source.

-Creeps
    Harvester
        /* Description
            This is one of the first level creeps
            It will harvest energy and move it to storage
            body size [WORK,CARRY,MOVE]
        */

        /* Outline of operation
            1. Creep spawns
            2. Finds nearest source that needs additional harvesters and puts in memory that it will now be harvesting that source
            3. moves to source
            4. harvests until full
            5. moves to nearest empty storage (right now extensions, needs to check everytime incase another harvester fills)
            6. drops off and then moves back to step 3
        */
        todo create logic that is persistent with tick updates (store in memory)
        todo Make it so harvesters move away from source if idle
        todo transfer from container to spawn/extensions if source is out of energy

    upGrader
        /* Description
            This is one of the first level creeps
            It will harvest energy and then upgrade the room controller
            body size [WORK,WORK,CARRY,MOVE,MOVE]
        */

        /* Outline of operation
            Operation at civLevel(0)
            1. Creep spawns
            2. Finds nearest source to the room controller and puts in memory that it will now be harvesting that source
            3. moves to source
            4. harvests until full
            5. moves to controller
            6. upgrades and then moves back to step 3
        */

    Builder
        /* Description
            This is one of the first level creeps
            It will take energy from storage and use it to construct buildings
            when there is nothing to be built it will turn into a repair creep
            body size [WORK,WORK,CARRY,MOVE,MOVE,MOVE]
        */

        /* Outline of operation
            operation at civLevel(0) [placing all building will be manual at this point in time]
            1. Creep spawns
            2. Finds nearest storage and fill
            3. moves to nearest construction site (can set building priorities later)
            4. starts and finishes build
            5. If there are additional construction sites and creep has enough energy to build goto step 3 else step 2
            6. If there are no more construction sites use remaining stored energy to repair nearest structure (can set priorities later)
            7. goto step 2
        */
            todo repairing will always go after closest job - make it so it chooses once and then sticks to it
            todo Walls only repair to certain hit points based on civLevel
            todo walls should repair up evenly

    Repair
        /* Description
            This is one of the first level creeps and will be a sub routine of the builder
            read above
        */

        /* Outline of operation
            repair all the things
        */
            todo Have it so logic will rank the lowest health ratio and creeps will repair that first
            todo Make it so creeps don't all just try to repair the same thing when above task is being used
            todo Creeps should repair ramparts to 5% health when they first build them

    The below creeps are still being outlined and will only be activated when civLevel != 0

    smallMiner
        todo body parts 1x Move, 7x work, 2x carry total of
        todo sets construction site of container or link next to where its harvesting (another link would be placed next to a storage)
        todo saves mining location in memory??
        todo 10 works and places energy in containers right next to it
    BigMiner
        todo same as above but 15 body parts number of MOVES equals 1/4 the amount of other parts and 18x work and 2x carry (30 parts? )
    Transporter
        todo create logic for transporter


    Solider
        todo use flag as rally points
    Spawner

-General Ideas
    todo All energy travel life: source -> link/link -> transporter/hauler -> storage -> hauler -> container -> upgraders/builder/repair -> worksite

-Useful information
    source regens every 300 ticks 3000 energy max in main room
    MOVE 50energy
    WORK 100energy harvests 2energy per-tick
    CARRY 50energy 50 resource units
