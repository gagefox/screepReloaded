/** This is the general ToDo List **//

-Room
    civLevel
        todo create civlevel function so the spawner will correctly spawn creeps

-Buildings
    Turret
        todo create actual logic

-Creeps
    Harvester
        todo Make it so harvesters move away from source if idle
        todo transfer from container to spawn/extensions if source is out of energy
    smallMiner
        todo body parts 1x Move, 7x work, 2x carry total of
        todo sets construction site of container or link next to where its harvesting (another link would be placed next to a storage)
        todo saves mining location in memory??
        todo 10 works and places energy in containers right next to it
    BigMiner
        todo same as above but 15 body parts number of MOVES equals 1/4 the amount of other parts and 18x work and 2x carry (30 parts? )
    Transporter
        todo create logic for transporter
    Builder
        todo repairing will always go after closest job - make it so it chooses once and then sticks to it
        todo Walls only repair to certain hit points based on civLevel
    Repair
        todo Have it so logic will rank the lowest health ratio and creeps will repair that first
        todo Make it so creeps don't all just try to repair the same thing when above task is being used
        todo Creeps should repair ramparts to 5% health when they first build them
    Solider
        todo use flag as rally points
    Spawner

-General Ideas
    todo All energy travel life: source -> link/link -> transporter/hauler -> storage -> hauler -> container -> upgraders/builder/repair -> worksite

-Useful information
    source regens every 300 ticks 3000 energy max in main room
    MOVE 50energy
    WORK 100energy harvests 2energy per-tick
    CARRY 50energy 50 resource units
